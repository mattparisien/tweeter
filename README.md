## File Description 
### **[client.js](https://github.com/mattparisien/tweeter/tree/master/public)**
- Contains all of the client-side logic for the application.
- Contains the following functions: 
    - *loadTweets*: submits a GET request to the /tweets/ route to retrieve an array of posted tweets. This function also resets the form and hides the l        loader, since it is called every time a post request completes.
    - *createTweetElement*: renders HTML markup for a new tweet item. The function dynamically inserts user input into the markup using template literals.        Takes tweet data as a parameter.
    - *renderTweets*: this function accepts an array of tweets as a parameter. It loops through the array and prepends each array item (each posted tweet) to the DOM container which holds them. 
    - *validateForm*: takes in a DOM form field as a parameter. The function checks for input field errors, such as an empty input field, or a field which contains over 140 characters. It returns an object with the key of "error", whose value specifies whether the input field contains an error or not, and "errorMsg", which will define the error in the form of a string.
